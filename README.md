I Built a recommender system for books with collaborative filtering using a data set found via <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/alexanderfrosati/goodbooks-10k-updated">Kaggle</a> that will recommend a total of 20 books to its user based on their past ratings of books on a scale of 1-5.

<h3> Why Did I Build This? </h3>
<p align='justify'>
My decision to build a recommender system for books stemmed from my love of reading books. Over the course of this pandemic, I've had A LOT of time to read, having read a book a week since the start of 2021. In order to feed my reading habits, I've spent hours scowering the internet looking for book recommendations, however I've noticed that these recommendations tend to be based on the genre of the last book I've read, which would be fine should I be interested in reading a similiar book to what I've just read, but rarely do these recommendations take into account the fact that I enjoy books from a variety of different genres.

Therefore, I've decided to combine my interest in data science with my love for books in order to build a recommender system that takes into account books that I would like my next recommendation to be based on, regardless of genre, through collaborative filtering.

 P.S. I am aware that getting a GoodReads account would probably solve my problem, but I think building this would be way more fun!
